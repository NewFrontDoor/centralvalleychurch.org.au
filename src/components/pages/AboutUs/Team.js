                                                    <p>
                                                        Pier and Kathryn met over 10 years ago at Macquarie University in Sydney and married in 2009. They have 3 children - Evangeline (6), Joash (4) and Norah (2). Pier being a Peruvian and Kathryn being a small-town country girl means that the bringing together of their mix of cultures has been a fun, rich and sometimes eye-opening experience.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Ideal time off would be spent getting outside together as a family, going for a run or enjoying the beaches of the Sunshine Coast at holiday time. They also love having people over and cooking for people. As fairly new Queenslanders they also enjoy exploring the surrounding areas and looking for those delicious food spots.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        They first lived in Sydney before moving to Yamba where they spent five years gaining valuable ministry experience as the associate pastor of Yamba Presbyterian Church before moving to Brisbane in 2015 for Pier to study at the Queensland Theological College.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Pier & Kathryn have spent the last few years working at Mitchelton Presbyterian Church & Coorparoo Presbyterian Church in Brisbane before joining the team at Central Church Ipswich at the start of 2018.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Since hearing about the opportunity to plant a church in the Ripley Valley God has grown in them a deep love for the people of Ripley and a desire to see the Ripley community filled with new followers of Jesus. They are passionate about reaching people with the gospel and helping them see how it is relevant to every part of life.

                                                    <h3>James Greenstreet - Ministry Trainee</h3>

                                                    <p>
                                                        James and Jaime-Lea Greenstreet have been part of the Central Church family since 2012. Both growing up in Ipswich and attending Bremer High, James and Jaime pursued a relationship with God together, landing them in the midst of God’s mission at Central Church. After studying Para-medicine, James moved on to full-time study at QTC, falling more in love with evangelism and the gospel. While Jaime, always with a heart set on Christ, pursued study in counselling and is now employed at Kambu Health Clinic, working alongside aboriginal families, as a family counsellor.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Through much deliberation and prayer, we both got involved because we believe that God’s message of Jesus death on the cross for our wrongdoings is the authentic, life-giving message, that is worth sharing to the ends of the earth. With a heart for Christ and his Word, we got involved because we want to share the Good News of Jesus with the lost in Ripley Valley. We are excited to see the Ripley Valley filled with disciples, who are lovingly and joyfully engaging in God’s mission. We are also excited and pumped to meet new people, have fun and get alongside others, to help grow their relationship with Jesus and to help them, lead others to him.
