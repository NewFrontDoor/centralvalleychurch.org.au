                                                        Our mission statement is essentially what we are doing (with complete dependance upon God) to bring our vision to reality.
                                                        We know that our involvement in this vision is much bigger and more vibrant than what a mission statement can convey, but it does capture the activity we want to be involved in.
                                                        It can be understood in three ways - making disciples, growing as disciples and leading people to Jesus.
                                                        The call to <u><em>make</em></u> disciples of Jesus is something we are deeply committed to and we believe this task is more than just a one-time experience or a Sunday activity. We believe discipleship is an on-going activity centred on a relationship with Jesus.
                                                        We are committed to making disciples by showing others what the bible says and helping them live out what Jesus says.
                                                        The second aspect of our mission is understanding that the nature of discipleship is both a living relationship with Jesus and a growing one. The relationship is not lifeless or stagnant but rather one that is active and growing.
                                                        We are committed to seeing these relationships grow. We also think this growth goes hand in hand with <u><em>leading</em></u> other people to Jesus through the way we live, speak and act in this world.
                                                        We believe we are ‘salt’ and ‘light,’ so by the very nature of being disciples we are the ones who will take initiative to lead people to Jesus.
                                                        We are to take the initiative in sharing, displaying, witnessing, proclaiming, heralding, exhorting, teaching and living out the Gospel.
                                                        We want the activity of the church to be focused on <u>making</u> disciples, <u>growing</u> disciples and <u>leading</u> other people to Jesus so that they too can live in <u>relationship with Jesus</u>.
