                                                    <h4>The Bible</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The Bible, as originally given, is God’s direct word to human beings. It is divinely inspired and infallible and it is the only and all-sufficient authority in all matters of faith and life. (Scripture References: 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Matthew 4:4-10; Matthew 5:17-19; 1 Corinthians 4:6).
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>God</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        God is one God and three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. (Scripture References: Isaiah 45:5-7; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 48:16; Matthew 3:16-17; Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14). God is living and active in the world as both creator and sustainer. He rules the world and all people in love, justice, grace and truth. (Scripture References: Genesis 1-2; Hebrews 1:3; Psalm 135:6; Acts 17:25-26; Psalm 103:8; Daniel 4:37; Psalm 86:15; Isaiah 45:19)
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>Revelation</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        God is a personal God and has revealed himself to mankind through his creation and the Bible. (Scripture References: Romans 1:18 – 2:16; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21)
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>The Human Problem</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The problem every human being has is sin. All people since the fall of Adam and Eve, by their very nature, are enemies of God (ie: sinners) and therefore under the condemnation of God. (Scripture References: Romans 1:18; Romans 3:10-11; Romans 5:10)
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>The Solution</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        In his abundant love God sent His Son, Jesus, into the world. Jesus’ death purchased forgiveness of sins for those who put their faith in him, because he has become their representative and substitute in death. Such a person is no longer God’s enemy, but is reconciled to God, not on the basis of good works, but because he or she is united with Christ by faith. (Scripture References: Romans 3:21-26; Romans 5:1-11; Romans 8:1; 1 Corinthians 5:21; Ephesians 2 8-9; Hebrews 10:10)
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>The Incarnation of Jesus</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Jesus Christ is the living Son of God, both fully God and fully man. He humbled himself to live as one of us on earth and to be our servant; an event called the incarnation. While on earth he lived a sinless life. His ultimate act of humility and servanthood was in giving his life as a ransom for ours (Scripture References: John 1:14; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 4:4; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 2:14-18; Hebrews 4:15; Mark 10:45).
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>The Resurrection and Ascension of Christ</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Jesus rose from the dead and on the third day appeared in his human, glorified body to more than 500 people before ascending to sit at the right hand of God the Father. We believe that in his resurrection he conquered death for mankind and now intercedes on behalf of his people and that one day he will come again as judge of all mankind. (Scripture References: Luke 24:50-53; Acts 17:31; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-8; Hebrews 9:23-28)
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>The Holy Spirit</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The work of the Holy Spirit is necessary for the salvation and life of every believer for it is the Spirit who illuminates the sinner to the things of God, convicting them of sin, who helps the believer in daily life, and who bears fruit in the believer’s life, making him/her more Christ-like. The believer receives the Holy Spirit, or is baptised by the Holy Spirit, when he or she is converted. The Spirit gives gifts to members of Christ’s body to be used for the benefit of those in Christ’s body and in the expansion of the Kingdom of God (Scripture References: John 16:4-15; Acts 2:1-13; Acts 5:32; 1 Corinthians 2:9-11; Galatians 5:16-26).
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h4>The Christian Life</h4>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Genuine commitment to Jesus Christ manifests in obedience to his word and a character in keeping with the internal work of the Holy Spirit. Such a person lives by the Spirit and wants his or her life to be completely to the glory of God (Scripture References: Luke 9:23-24; Romans 8:5; Romans 12:1-2; 1 John 2: 3; 1 John 5:3).
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
