                                                        Our vision statement captures what we want to see God do in the Ripley Valley. It also captures the things we care about.
                                                        Firstly, that <u>disciples are being made</u>. It is the great commission that Christ gave His church<sup>1</sup> and we believe this is the task that breathes life into church.
                                                        We also care about the heart motivation behind the drive ‘to make disciples’ so we use the words ‘joyfully’<sup>2</sup> and ‘lovingly’ to capture both the willingness and intention of the church to carry out God’s mission.<sup>3</sup>
                                                        We think love is an important aspect to highlight because it is the attitude that shows others that we are Jesus’ disciples<sup>4</sup> and it sums up the commandments that we are to grow and mature in.<sup>5</sup>
                                                        We also think ‘joy’ a crucial characteristic of both the Christian and the church. ‘Joy’ is not simply a feeling of happiness but a deep-seated hope in Jesus that governs our actions, emotions and passions.
                                                        It sees God’s glory as ultimate. The use of the word ‘mission’ here communicates something really important to us. It captures the biblical and theological idea that our God is a missional God.
                                                        He had a plan and purpose to bring all things under Christ.<sup>6</sup> And we also believe that the church has an important role in this mission. God’s work and our actions are complimentary.
                                                        God uses the church to accomplish this mission. The word also captures the multifaceted nature of what God is doing in our world.
                                                        He is not only transforming lives in making disciples but also growing and maturing them into the likeness of His Son, Jesus. The phrase captures this idea of movement.
                                                        The church should never become stagnate or only inward focused. The church should be both growing and maturing in Christ and reaching all people with the gospel, continuing in this task until Christ returns.
