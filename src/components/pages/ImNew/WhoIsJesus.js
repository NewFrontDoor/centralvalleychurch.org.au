                                                     Who is Jesus? It would be fair to say Jesus is one of the most influential people in human history as thousands of books, articles, popular media references have been made over him. The answer to this important question is important. The impact Jesus has had on our world is immense.

                                                    <p>
                                                     His claims were pretty remarkable. Born over two thousand years ago in the city of Bethlehem, Jesus claimed to be the saviour of the world. He claimed to have come to seek and save the lost. He claimed to fix everything broken and wrong with this world. He claimed to have come into the world to give life and life abundantly. He claimed that he is the way, the truth and the life and that it is only through him people can be restored into relationship with God. He also claimed that He is the judge of the living and the dead and that His death is the key to our life, not just now but for all eternity! As dramatic as they are, these claims received incredible support when Jesus rose from the dead. Jesus basically presents himself as God’s story and the answer to our world’s greatest problem (sin) but more than that, the answer to life’s greatest joys and delights too.

                                                    We love creating opportunities for people to ask questions, investigate and see if this whole Jesus thing is legit. So we want to invite you to come to church to find out more or to come along to one of our ‘Look into Life with Jesus series’ (Life Course). It’s a fun and relaxed way to investigate the claims of Jesus.
